I am interested in everything about **machine learning** and **data-heavy systems**. I am currently working with [Prof. Hui Fang](https://www.ece.udel.edu/people/faculty/hfang/) at [FSAN](https://lerner.udel.edu/programs/phd-programs/financial-services-analytics-phd/) about **fairness evaluation** and **fair ranking** algorithms for information retrieval systems (open web search) using **NLP**, **LLMs**, **RAG**, and other machine learning techniques.

I enjoy working on **quantitative research** on financial content for bussiness insights and **software development** to build robust piplines for ML algorithms and search applications.

Having a solid backgound in computer science, I am an experienced data engineer/scientist/architect in building robust ETL piplines and RESTful APIs, automating data processes, and designing dashboards and reports.

I am also a big fan of Ski ‚õ∑Ô∏è, Kayak üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and Road Trip üõ£Ô∏è.
